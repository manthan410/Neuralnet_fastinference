def optimize(model, **kwargs):
    """Performs swap optimization. Swaps two child nodes if the probability to visit the left tree is smaller than the probability to visit the right tree. This way, the probability to visit the left tree is maximized which in-turn improves the branch-prediction during pipelining in the CPU. 
    You can activate this optimization by simply passing :code:`"swap"` to the optimizer, e.g.

    .. code-block::
